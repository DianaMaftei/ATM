# Projects

A collection of various projects I work on during class.

ATM - simulating an ATM, with the ability to check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, view past transactions and change password. Extra options for the admin account: add user, reactivate user account, turn off ATM for maintenance.

eCatalog - simulating an online portal where students can view their grade information and attendance and where teachers can assign grades.
